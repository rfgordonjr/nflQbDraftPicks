## Introduction

On the [May 1st episode of The Bill Simmons Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2CA9fancUIX8mcCvtINQCh?si=8j9liBziSxGXmAe7U7VpRQ) Bill says around the 32:58 mark that the Dolphins should have considered drafting a 2nd quarterback with their 3rd pick in the first round of the 2020 draft. Here's the full quote:

> Its 50/50 right? if you take a qb in the first round the math over the last 20 years say you have a 50% chance of hitting on the guy and there are all these factors, theres no way to know for sure... its 50/50. 

Let's unpack this. According to Simmons,

- The probability that a pick that is used on a quarterback in the first round is a "good" one is 0.5.
- There's math somewhere that shows this.
- Factors exist that support this hypothesis.

Let's see if this has any merit. 5 seconds of google searching offers no math. Its entirely possible its true, but I haven't spent the time looking for it. Figured it would be more fun to estimate it myself anyway!

Let's do the following:

- Pull all the data from first round quarterback selections from the last 20 years.
- Define what "good" means. We'll a combination of these two:
    - Started a Super Bowl
    - Named to a Pro Bowl
- Find factors that contribute to the likelihood of "good."
